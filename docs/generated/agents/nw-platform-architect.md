# nw-platform-architect

Use for DESIGN wave (infrastructure design) and DEVOP wave (deployment execution, production readiness, stakeholder sign-off). Transforms architecture into deployable infrastructure, then coordinates production delivery and outcome measurement.

**Wave:** DESIGN
**Model:** inherit
**Max turns:** 50
**Tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, Task

## Skills

- [cicd-and-deployment](../../../nWave/skills/platform-architect/cicd-and-deployment.md) — CI/CD pipeline design methodology, deployment strategies, GitHub Actions patterns, and branch/release strategies. Load when designing pipelines or deployment workflows.
- [deliver-orchestration](../../../nWave/skills/platform-architect/deliver-orchestration.md) — DELIVER wave orchestration workflow -- 9 phases from baseline to finalization. Load when user invokes *deliver command. Covers state tracking, smart skip logic, retry, resume, and quality gate enforcement.
- [deployment-strategies](../../../nWave/skills/platform-architect/deployment-strategies.md) — Deployment patterns (canary, blue-green, rolling), rollback procedures, risk assessment, and contingency planning. Load when orchestrating deployment or preparing rollback plans.
- [infrastructure-and-observability](../../../nWave/skills/platform-architect/infrastructure-and-observability.md) — Infrastructure as Code patterns (Terraform, Kubernetes), observability design (SLOs, metrics, alerting, dashboards), and pipeline security stages. Load when designing infrastructure, observability, or security scanning.
- [platform-engineering-foundations](../../../nWave/skills/platform-architect/platform-engineering-foundations.md) — Foundational platform engineering knowledge from key references -- Continuous Delivery, SRE, Accelerate, Team Topologies, Chaos Engineering, and Secure Delivery. Load when contextual grounding in platform engineering theory is needed.
- [production-readiness](../../../nWave/skills/platform-architect/production-readiness.md) — Monitoring, observability, operational procedures, CI/CD lessons learned, and quality gate definitions. Load when assessing production readiness or validating operational excellence.
- [stakeholder-engagement](../../../nWave/skills/platform-architect/stakeholder-engagement.md) — Demonstration preparation, audience-tailored presentations, feedback collection, and business outcome measurement. Load when preparing demos or measuring business value delivery.
