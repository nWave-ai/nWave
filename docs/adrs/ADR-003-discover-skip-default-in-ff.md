# ADR-003: DISCOVER Wave Skipped by Default in Fast-Forward

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The `/nw:ff` command chains remaining waves sequentially. The DISCOVER wave requires interactive customer interview data (Mom Test interviews, assumption testing) that cannot be auto-generated by a pipeline. Including it in the default fast-forward sequence would block the chain on interactive discovery that contradicts the fast-forward intent.

## Decision

Skip DISCOVER by default in `/nw:ff`. The default chain is DISCUSS > DESIGN > DEVOPS > DISTILL > DELIVER. Users can opt in to DISCOVER via `--from=discover`.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Include DISCOVER in default chain**: Would provide the complete pipeline but would block on interactive discovery, defeating the purpose of fast-forward. Rejected.
- **Auto-detect and skip if DISCOVER artifacts exist**: More nuanced but adds complexity for a case where DISCOVER is rarely the right entry point for fast-forward users (who typically have clear requirements). Rejected in favor of the simpler default-skip rule.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: Fast-forward lives up to its name -- no blocking on interactive discovery. Users who need discovery can still opt in explicitly.
- **Negative**: Users who genuinely need problem validation might skip it. Mitigated by `/nw:new` recommending DISCOVER when appropriate, and the `--from=discover` opt-in.
