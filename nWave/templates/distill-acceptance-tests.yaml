  # Template Usage Instructions

  This moderately interactive template supports comprehensive acceptance test creation and production service integration for the DISTILL wave of the nWave methodology.

  ## Customization Guidelines

  1. **Adapt scenario templates** to match your business domain and terminology
  2. **Configure production service integration** based on your technology stack and architecture
  3. **Customize test automation framework** to align with your development and deployment pipeline
  4. **Implement business validation patterns** appropriate for your business metrics and KPIs

  ## Success Indicators

  - ✅ Acceptance tests written in business language understandable by stakeholders
  - ✅ All step methods call production services via dependency injection
  - ✅ One-E2E-at-a-time strategy implemented and operational
  - ✅ Business outcomes validated through real system integration
  - ✅ Test automation framework configured and executing successfully

  ## Next Wave Preparation

  Use the acceptance tests and production service integration framework from this template as the driving force for Outside-In TDD implementation in the DELIVER wave, ensuring test-driven development with real business validation.
