  # Template Usage Instructions

  This highly interactive template supports comprehensive architectural design and visual communication for the DESIGN wave of the nWave methodology.

  ## Customization Guidelines

  1. **Adapt architectural patterns** to match your technology choices and constraints
  2. **Customize visual representations** for your stakeholder groups and communication needs
  3. **Select technologies** that support both your business requirements and ATDD methodology
  4. **Design service interfaces** using business language and domain terminology

  ## Success Indicators

  - ✅ Hexagonal architecture designed with clear business logic isolation
  - ✅ Visual architecture documentation approved by all stakeholder groups
  - ✅ Technology stack selected and validated for ATDD compatibility
  - ✅ Service layer designed for acceptance test integration
  - ✅ Architecture supports automated diagram generation and synchronization

  ## Next Wave Preparation

  Use the architectural design and technology specifications from this template as foundation for acceptance test creation in the DISTILL wave, ensuring seamless transition from design to test-driven implementation.
